1. create reel with loading state
2. infinite scrolling - with loading state
3. [if] infinte scrolling - static number of dom items
4. [else] infinte scrolling - how to use remove previous dom nodes?
5. only current reel should be played. previous should show paused video player. next reels should show thumbnail until video player is loaded.
6. clickable button with animations. double click. like. single click - mute
7. 


infinite scrolling - with loading state
 - reel is currentReel = play reel
 - else pause/stop reel
 - next reel = donot load video player. show thumbnail

// sync issues. code works fine something else is fucked.
 if (current reel) { // or video loaded
    load url in the video tag
    // play video
 } else {
    show thumbnail
    // pause/ stop video
}

- use thumbnail and infinite reel loading - done
- have static amount of nodes
  - can have 3 nodes (prev, current, next)
  - currently every reel has an intersection observer. which is inefficient
  - maintain current idx. based on that, prev/ curr/ next can be calculated.
    - initially current idx = 0
  - based on scroll, first load. maintain these three nodes.
  - null checks for these 3 nodes.
- allow actions only on the current reel
- use another video player
